3. Add the environment variables
    - `DOMAIN`: domain name for the host machine
    - `PORT`: local port of the relay server 

    to the file `/etc/caddy/.env` and run `sudo systemctl edit caddy
` and add the line
    ```
    [Service]
    EnvironmentFile=/etc/caddy/.env
    ```
    to add the variables to the service environment
4. Enable Caddy on boot: `sydo systemctl enable caddy`
5. Start Caddy: `sudo systemctl start caddy`
